4.3.1 a)
A = 2^6 (mod 4)
A = 0
B = 2^3 (mod 4)
B = 0
S = 0

4.3.1 b)
A = 78^6 (mod 33)
A = 12^6
A = 12^6
A = 144^3
A = 12^3
A = 12*144
A = 12*12
A = 144
A = 12

B = 12^3 (mod 33)
B = 12*144
B = 12*12
B = 144
B = 12

S = A^3 (mod 33)
S = 12^3
S = 12

S = B^6 (mod 33)
S = 12^6
S = 12


4.3.2
2^(-1) (mod 6) is undefined because you cannot multiply 2 with anything that will create a remainder of 1.
This is because 2 is a prime factor of 6
